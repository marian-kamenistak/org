There are lots of guides on how to develop an application, but much less guides on **how to build a tech company**. During the growth of **[Mews](https://mews.com)**, we realized that we not only build SaaS product for our customers. We also build the organization itself. For example in tech department we structure divisions, put teams together, establish career ladders, determine salaries, put processes in place, deliver the product, run code reviews or postmortems etc. etc. And we don't need to stop at boundaries of technical department, there are even less resources when it comes to finance, reporting, planning, legal or operations.

Therefore we decided to **share our practices**, processes, frameworks and guidelines, following the **open-source** spirit. Shout-out to GitLab, their [handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/) has been a great inspiration. We're a bit smaller company, so our guide might be relevant to other startups and early scaleups.

## Contents

This is an ongoing and never ending work in progress... However all the things that we publish here are **being actively used by our employees**, we have no "private" versions of that we'd use internally.
