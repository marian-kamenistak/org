# Career Framework

Our career framework is built bottom-up, which means it starts with very specific low-level skills which you can acquire. Having those skills advances you in different [competencies](competencies.md) where you basically level-up when you acquire new skills. Those competencies and levels reached there determine your overall career [progress](progress.md) within your [career track](career-tracks/readme.md). The career track is quite specific already and together with the progress, it determines your [job grade](grades.md), job title, salary bounds, [compensation](compensation.md) and also responsibilities (job description).

In order to determine all of this and **ensure that everyone progresses forward**, we do [performance reviews](performance-reviews.md) every six months. During a performance review, your manager will hold a general career discussion with you, you will [assess your competencies](competency-assessment.md) with the manager and establish [personal goals](personal-goals.md) for the upcoming six months. To make sure you work on your personal goals, there will be three [performance catchups.md](performance-catchups) where your manager will check up on your goals and help you in any way possible to **achieve the goals**.
