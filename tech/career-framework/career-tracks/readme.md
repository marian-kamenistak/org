# Career Tracks

There are multiple different roles and¬†**career tracks**¬†you can pursue, the main distinction is into individual contributor and management tracks. The main difference obviously is that a manager manages people which by default increases their responsibility. But this does not mean, that in order to progress in your career, you need to become manager. This is a choice and an¬†**expert individual contributor is as valuable as a senior manager**. We try to reflect this in the compensation as well. Among individual contributor career tracks, you are able to switch pretty much freely. In order to get to one of the management career tracks, you need to be assigned that role, you cannot choose this on your own :)

Everybody in the tech team has a career track which impacts several things. Your career track defines which competencies you should focus on, which skills are important for your development, what are your responsibilities, career goals etc. It also defines what should be your minimal compensation based on your progress. Or vice versa, based on your competencies, you might discover which career track is the most fitting for you.

## Overview

As mentioned in the definition of career [progress](../progress.md), different [competencies](../competencies.md) are important for different career tracks. This will come handy during your first performance review when doing a self-assessment. Here's an overview of competency importance for each career track:
