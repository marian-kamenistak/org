# Performance Catchups

Since 6 months is a long time, the follow-up from the previous performance review can be easily forgotten. In order to ensure incremental progress on your goals, possible steering and adjustments, you should talk about your personal goals on your performance catchup.

This is an event that takes place bi-monthly, make sure that this is clearly separated from your regular 1-2-1s. The **main goal is to check progress on you goals** and address any issues that arose. To ensure you have enough space for your growth steps, use the `Personal` tasks in the issue tracking software and do not hesitate to plan it as part of a sprint.
